        <p>
          I am a computer science student at Augusta University currently in my final year.
          I'm comfortable in Kotlin, JS, Java, and C#. I am familiar with DBMS including MySQL, 
          SQL Server, and MongoDB. I primarily use Angular and express.js along with handlebars
          and Sass in web development and am most comfortable with the MEAN stack. However,
          I am also familiar with Razor HTML templating and ASP.NET MVC architecture. 
        </p>
        <p>
          In desktop development I tend to use Kotlin for Android and console development but I am familiar with using C# to create console
          applications, simple WinForm apps, and Unity scripts. I am also very interested
          and have some experience in Docker/Kubernetes as well as AWS and GCP. I have extensive
          personal experience in Linux system management/dev-ops and run a Proxmox hypervisor
          server at home as a development enviroment.
        </p>
        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>
          As a child I moved often with my family until moving to Georgia in 2010. I am one of 3; with
          2 younger, fraternal twin sisters named Lauren and Leslie. My father is an electrical
          engineer and currently lives in Seguin, TX with his girlfriend Yvonne. I currently live 
          with my girlfriend, Morgan Smith, near downtown Augusta.
        </p>
        <p>
          I enjoy reading, hiking, playing guitar, and teaching myself new technologies in my free time. 
          I tend to work best with clear goals in a team however I can just as easily work
          on my own if the need arises. Moving so often when I was younger has made it very easy for
          me to adapt to change and in addition to this I'm an extremely quick learner who picks up on
          new concepts very quickly.
